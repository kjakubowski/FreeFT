TODO: prioritize bugs

- Wrong mouse position before moving it for the first time

- In res_viewer when popup is visible, you can still select objects behind it by
  clicking on screen (outside of popup area)

- In release build some bugs (no sound file, etc.) should be handled silently or, logged to a text file

- When standing near a wall, you can fire through it (projectiles spawn too far away)

- Duplicated sprites: Robot turrets

- Fix problem with mixed upper/lower case of paths to resources

- Crash when shooting at the automatic doors in the long corridor with M60 (game:237 (conversion to container))

- Client cannot connect to server when started much earlier

- Handle situation when client connection was broken, but server still expects
  normal communication on some specific port, and client tries to reconnect

- Still some problems with drawing order when lots of entities & explosions
- Entities shouldn't break order of tiles when rendering

- Often death sounds are not played (in multiplayer mode)
- Door sounds don't work in multiplayer
- Robots have no hit sounds

- Visible tearing when vsync (glfwSwapInterval(1)) is on

- Mutants cannot use rifles

- When changing armour, it should happen on event pickup, not when animation has finished

- Projectiles that are out of range do not blend out

- Some problems with tracking, when player wants to attack a scorpion moving towards him
  (sometimes tracking ends too early)

- Make sure that it's impossible to impact an object behind a wall

- Sometimes players cannot find a way to the door opened nearby (on mission05 lower level, rotating doors)

- findClosestPos could return multiple points, if for some reason on of them is unreachable
  (think this through). Problems arise when were trying to get to some door when lot's of AI's are running around

- Problem with tracking for AI: sometimes they move a very small amount, quickly changing animation from run to idle

- Bullets shouldnt create sparks when actors are hit
- Problem with direction of flamer's projectile

- Attacking on stairs may caus player to get stuck

- Fix flamer

- In multiplayer mode, player can get kicked into doors and get stuck

- When trying to teleport in client, AIs react (for a single frame)
