Mustfix: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- AI's get stuck all the time
- Animation glitches in multiplayer  
- Problems with queuing orders
- When actor is putting the armor on, user has to wait with clicing on another armor until he finishes 
- When standing near a wall, you can fire through it (projectiles spawn too far away)
- Make sure that it's impossible to impact an object behind a wall
- Crash when shooting at the automatic doors in the long corridor with M60 (game:237 (conversion to container))
- Client cannot connect to server when started much earlier
- Handle situation when client connection was broken, but server still expects
  normal communication on some specific port, and client tries to reconnect
- Visible tearing when vsync (glfwSwapInterval(1)) is on
- Projectiles that are out of range do not blend out
- m60 single shot sound cannot be hear in multiplayer

- In multiplayer mode, player can get kicked into doors and get stuck
- Attacking on stairs may caus player to get stuck
- When trying to teleport in client, AIs react (for a single frame)

- Some problems with tracking, when player wants to attack a scorpion moving towards him
  (sometimes tracking ends too early)
- Sometimes players cannot find a way to the door opened nearby (on mission05 lower level, rotating doors)
- Problem with tracking for AI: sometimes they move a very small amount, quickly changing animation from run to idle
- HudStats are a little too big (20 pixels bigger than HudMainPanel)



Nice to fix: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Wrong mouse position before moving it for the first time
- Duplicated sprites: Robot turrets
- Fix problem with mixed upper/lower case of paths to resources
- In res_viewer when popup is visible, you can still select objects behind it by
  clicking on screen (outside of popup area)
- Still some problems with drawing order when lots of entities & explosions
- Entities shouldn't break order of tiles when rendering
- Robots have no hit sounds
- When changing armour, it should happen on event pickup, not when animation has finished
- Sometimes main menu music is still being played in the game



Secondary: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix flamer
- Problem with direction of flamer's projectile



Fixed: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Door sounds don't work in multiplayer
- Mutants can equip leather armor in multiplayer
- In multiplayer sometimes players are stuck
