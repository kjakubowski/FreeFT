- think about handling orders on client / server and replication

- convert should be run automaticly by game or editor. Some text file should also be created
  with information about file format versions, so that when .sprite format changes, the game
  won't crash, but will re-create all sprites automaticly.

- use librocket instead of my own UI?

- Remove event filters from orders (unnecessary)

- Preloading sprites not so fast on non-SSD drives

- Looking through some of the entities (look-through flag?)
