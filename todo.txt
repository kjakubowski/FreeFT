- Network security (at least against hostile packets)

- think about handling orders on client / server and replication

- convert should be run automaticly by game or editor. Some text file should also be created
  with information about file format versions, so that when .sprite format changes, the game
  won't crash, but will re-create all sprites automaticly.

- use librocket instead of my own UI?
  Answer: NO: for the editor current UI is good enough, in-game should'nt be based
  on standard controls like buttons. Use your imagination!

- Remove event filters from orders (unnecessary)

- Looking through some of the entities (look-through flag?)

- Blending in/out entities when getting out of/into invisible occluder

- Remove actor event flags from orders

- Sounds should be played in the middle of entity
- Add sound attenuation

- Add looped walk / run sounds

- when projectiles are being shot vertically, their angle could be altered a bit

- Possibility to explode dead bodies if they are not yet exploded :D

- Add damage_def class which is defined in xml:
 damage="bullet(10) fire(100)"
 damage_mod="all(1.5)"
 damage_res="all(0.1) fire(0.2)"

- verification of resources on client side, because they might be different than on server side

- better camera work

- 9Patch images for GUI

- If the last interactor with a door was a player, then he should see when the door closes

- When player is moving in one direction for a very short distance, he shouldn't rotate

- Use shared_ptr<> instead of Ptr<> ? (safety issues in multithreaded environment)

REFACTORING:
- move EntityWorldProxy, EntityRef to separate files?
- make EntityWorldProxy::ref() const
- make Entity access functions both const and non-const (it's ok to do them with const-casts)
- If sprites are kept in a big pool, then PSprite is no longer required and sprite doesn't have to inherit from RefCounter?
- bind0 -> unbind
- use rects in drawQuads
- ?? Make rects and boxes store position and size, not min and max
- In Equip/unequip orders ise items as attributes, not indices into inventories
- Normal Inheritence for items
