- think about handling orders on client / server and replication

- convert should be run automaticly by game or editor. Some text file should also be created
  with information about file format versions, so that when .sprite format changes, the game
  won't crash, but will re-create all sprites automaticly.

- use librocket instead of my own UI?

- Remove event filters from orders (unnecessary)

- Preloading sprites not so fast on non-SSD drives

- Looking through some of the entities (look-through flag?)

- Blending in/out entities when getting out of/into invisible occluder

- Remove actor event flags from orders

- Sounds should be played in the middle of entity
- Add sound attenuation

- Add looped walk / run sounds

- when projectiles are being shot vertically, their angle could be altered a bit

- Possibility to explode dead bodies if they are not yet exploded :D

REFACTORING:
- move EntityWorldProxy, EntityRef to separate files?
- make EntityWorldProxy::ref() const
- make Entity access functions both const and non-const (it's ok to do them with const-casts)
