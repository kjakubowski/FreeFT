- fix (most of) graphics glitches that show up on different FOT maps (DONE)
  - still visible on map mission07; if you cant sort the tiles properly, at least
    make sure that sorting order wont change rapidly, when the player moves the camera;
    We can do that by offsetting the grid as camera moves, so that in each grid node there is
    always the same set of objects, and hopefully in the same order; grid nodes can also be partially
    precomputed and sorted;
- smooth running around original maps: NavigationMap with true 3d support  (DONE except secondaries)
  - multi-layered heightmap  DONE
  - conversion from heightmap to bitmap in Navigationmap  DONE
  - when moving some collision tests should be made to make sure, player is on correct height  DONE
  - proper movement over tiles with different height  DONE
  - SECONDARY: proper moving through diagonals (without diagonals its still good enough)
  - SECONDARY: quickly finding adjacent quads (also from different levels)
- hiding upper floors, so that player is visible  (DONE except secondaries)
  - selecting occluder maps byb represetative in the editor  DONE
  - hiding/showing tiles belonging to occlusion maps in the game based on the player position
    (if player is being occluded)  DONE
  - rethink occluders, so that entities can be easily included entities  DONE (works for entities)
  - SECONDARY: generating occlusion bitmap and small number of occlusion rects from occlusion maps
  - SECONDARY: using occlusion bitmaps to connect occluded tiles to occluders
- fix some of the TODO-s  DONE
- pick best GPL license, add copyright notices  DONE
- Use Open Sourced fonts  DONE
- add license for baselib also  DONE
- find better name: FreeFT  DONE
- mod file format: patch on original xml map file, loading&saving in editor  DONE
- Tile animations  DONE
- basic (working) entity editor  DONE
- fixed crouching animation  DONE
- write basic readme with acknowledgements  DONE
- convert should be able to take FOT path, and extract and convert all necessary resources  DONE
- put up on github, announce on nma-fallout  DONE

- SECONDARY: some enemies with basic AI (scorpions)
- SECONDARY: pack tiles into single file, so they will load faster?
- SECONDARY: in the game use shift to select surface on a level relative somehow to the players position
- SECONDARY: ethereal tiles
- SECONDARY: rendering overlays
