- fix (most of) graphics glitches that show up on different FOT maps (DONE)
  - still visible on map mission07; if you cant sort the tiles properly, at least
    make sure that sorting order wont change rapidly, when the player moves the camera;
    We can do that by offsetting the grid as camera moves, so that in each grid node there is
    always the same set of objects, and hopefully in the same order; grid nodes can also be partially
    precomputed and sorted;
- smooth running around original maps: NavigationMap with true 3d support
  - multi-layered heightmap  DONE
  - conversion from heightmap to bitmap in Navigationmap  DONE
  - when moving some collision tests should be made to make sure, player is on correct height  DONE
  - proper movement over tiles with different height  DONE
  - proper moving through diagonals
  - SECONDARY: quickly finding adjacent quads (also from different levels)
- some enemies with basic AI (scorpions)
- hiding upper floors, so that player is visible
  - selecting occluder maps byb represetative in the editor  DONE
  - generating occlusion bitmap and small number of occlusion rects from occlusion maps
  - using occlusion bitmaps to connect tiles to occluders
  - hiding/showing tiles belonging to occlusion maps in the game based on the player position
    (if player is being occluded)
- convert should be able to take FOT path, and extract and convert all necessary resources
- Tile animations
- Use Open Sourced fonts

- pick best GPL license
- put up on github, announce on nma-fallout
